# OpenGL-Compat-Game

As unfortunate as it is, I like low-level things, but haven't exactly worked with low-level APIs yet.  
This project is me doing *exactly* that, and making sure I actually put my skills to use.  
Data-oriented design, **simple code**, and a lot of patience.  
PS I'm *also* using only CLI tools! *No VSCode!*  

# Building

...For now, I think it's just `cmake .` in your terminal, because I do provide you with a `CMakeLists.txt`.  
However... I must say, that Debian 12 is **the only environment** I *know* this project builds on.  
...  
Make sure to install `libglfw3` and `libglfw3-dev`!
